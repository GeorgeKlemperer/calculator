## 1. Context and Problem Statement

### 1.1 Background

- **Business Drivers:**  
  Develop a travel web application that allows users to plan trips, view weather forecasts, search for flights via the Skyscanner API, and track budgets—all within a few hours using an LLM.
- **Technical Challenges:**  
  Integrating multiple third-party APIs (Skyscanner, OpenWeatherMap), ensuring offline access, and managing error handling efficiently.

- **Constraints and Limitations:**  
  Rapid MVP build; scope limited to current functionalities; need for scalability without over-engineering; reliance on Firebase for most backend services.

### 1.2 Problem Definition

- **Technical Requirements:**

  - Full integration of the Skyscanner API and all current features.
  - Use of Firebase for authentication, database (Firestore), and hosting.
  - Responsive UI with basic trip management and itinerary planning.

- **System Complexity:**  
  Keeping the system simple (KISS) for rapid delivery while laying a foundation for future scalability.

- **Performance Expectations:**  
  Core content should load within 2 seconds on a stable connection; handle up to 100 concurrent users.

## 2. Decision Drivers

### 2.1 Technical Constraints

- **Technology Stack Limitations:**  
  Firebase as a backend solution; direct API calls from the frontend are acceptable.
- **Performance Requirements:**  
  Fast load times with efficient integration of third-party APIs.
- **Integration Needs:**  
  Skyscanner and OpenWeatherMap APIs must be fully integrated.

### 2.2 Business Constraints

- **Cost Limitations:**  
  Use free tiers and existing services (Firebase) where possible.
- **Time-to-Market Pressures:**  
  Build and deliver an MVP in just a few hours.
- **Scalability Requirements:**  
  A simple yet solid foundation that allows incremental improvements.

## 3. Considered Alternatives

### 3.1 Alternative 1: Direct Frontend Integration with Firebase and Third-Party APIs

- **Description:**  
  Build the MVP with direct calls from the React frontend to Firebase, Skyscanner, and OpenWeatherMap.
- **Pros:**
  - Rapid development, minimal intermediary layers.
  - Direct access simplifies debugging and iteration.
- **Cons:**
  - Tightly coupled API calls may lead to refactoring in the future.
  - Error handling is managed within the frontend, potentially increasing complexity if not modularized.
- **Fit with Requirements:**  
  Meets the rapid delivery goal while offering a clear path to incorporate enhancements later.

### 3.2 Alternative 2: Introduce a Backend API Layer via Firebase Cloud Functions

- **Description:**  
  Use Firebase Cloud Functions as a mediator for all external API calls.
- **Pros:**
  - Abstracts third-party integrations.
  - Centralizes error handling and logging.
- **Cons:**
  - Adds complexity and extra development overhead.
  - Might be over-engineering for a few-hour MVP.
- **Fit with Requirements:**  
  Better for long-term scalability but not optimal for rapid delivery in the MVP phase.

### 3.3 Alternative 3: Hybrid Approach with Direct Calls and Selective Cloud Functions

- **Description:**  
  Use direct calls for non-critical functionalities while leveraging Cloud Functions only for key integrations like Skyscanner.
- **Pros:**
  - Balances rapid development with some abstraction.
  - Allows quick iterations on simpler features.
- **Cons:**
  - Inconsistent architecture may lead to future refactoring.
  - Increased complexity in error handling if not uniformly applied.
- **Fit with Requirements:**  
  Offers a middle ground but risks introducing architectural inconsistencies.

## 4. Decision Outcome

### 4.1 Chosen Alternative

**Direct Frontend Integration with Firebase and Third-Party APIs (Alternative 1)**

- **Core Architectural Pattern:**  
  A straightforward, client-centric architecture where the React frontend directly communicates with Firebase services and external APIs.
- **Key Technology Choices:**
  - **Frontend:** React with built-in component state and Context API for global state management.
  - **Backend & Hosting:** Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Hosting) with built-in local persistence.
  - **Third-Party Integration:** Direct API calls to Skyscanner and OpenWeatherMap.
  - **Error Handling:** Centralized error boundaries in React and logging mechanisms.
  - **Testing:** Basic Jest unit testing.
- **Rationale for Selection:**  
  This approach allows us to meet the few-hour build target while ensuring that foundational design is maintained. It embraces the KISS principle, minimizes unnecessary abstraction, and still leaves room for future scalability and modularization.

### 4.2 Positive Consequences

- **Rapid Development:**  
  Direct API calls and use of Firebase enable quick development.
- **Maintainability:**  
  Clear separation of concerns within the frontend using React's Context API and component state.
- **Scalability:**  
  The architecture is simple enough to be refactored and extended later with minimal disruption.
- **Reliability:**  
  Centralized error boundaries and basic Jest testing enhance reliability and ease debugging.

### 4.3 Negative Consequences

- **Coupling:**  
  Direct calls from the frontend may lead to tighter coupling with third-party APIs, which could necessitate refactoring for more complex requirements later.
- **Limited Abstraction:**  
  Lack of a dedicated backend API layer may limit advanced features such as complex data aggregation or enhanced security for API keys in future iterations.

## 5. Technical Architecture

### 5.1 System Components

- **Frontend:**  
  React application with pages for Login, Trip List, Trip Dashboard, Trip Edit, Add Flight, and Add Itinerary.
- **Backend Services:**  
  Firebase for Authentication, Firestore for data storage, and Firebase Hosting for deployment.
- **Third-Party Integrations:**  
  Direct integration with Skyscanner API for flight search and OpenWeatherMap for weather data.
- **Error Handling:**  
  Global React error boundaries paired with logging mechanisms.

### 5.2 Technical Interfaces

- **APIs:**  
  Direct RESTful calls from the frontend to third-party APIs and Firebase SDK.
- **Data Exchange:**  
  JSON over HTTPS, with appropriate error handling and retry mechanisms as needed.
- **Integration Points:**  
  Firebase Auth, Firestore rules, and external API endpoints.

### 5.3 Performance Considerations

- **Scaling Strategies:**  
  Firebase’s managed services ensure horizontal scaling; caching provided by Firebase’s local persistence.
- **Caching Mechanisms:**  
  Rely on Firebase's built-in caching and local persistence for offline access.
- **Resource Optimization:**  
  Optimize API calls and minimize re-renders in React by careful state management.

### 5.4 Security Architecture
