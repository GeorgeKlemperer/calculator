# Detailed Phases

## 1. Project Initialisation

**Objective:** Establish the foundational development environment.

_Note: This assumes you are already inside a Git repository with `plan.md`, `spec.md`, and `adr.md` in the root folder._

### 1.1 Organise Project Structure

> **Task 1 - Prompt:**
>
> ```text
> Organise the project structure by creating necessary directories if they don't already exist:
> - Create a `frontend` directory for the React app.
> - Create a `backend` directory for Firebase functions (if needed later).
> - Ensure a `docs` directory exists for extended project documentation.
> - Create a `tests` directory for unit and integration tests.
> Update the existing repository's README.md if necessary to reflect the new structure.
> ```

### 1.2 Environment Setup and Dependency Installation

> **Task 2 - Prompt:**
>
> ```text
> Set up the development environment:
> - Initialize a new React project inside the `frontend` directory using Create React App (or your chosen scaffolding tool).
> - Install Firebase, React Router (for navigation), and any basic UI dependencies.
> - Create configuration files for environment variables (e.g., .env) for API keys (Firebase, Skyscanner, OpenWeatherMap).
> - Verify that the app runs locally.
> ```

### 1.3 Basic Code Scaffolding

> **Task 3 - Prompt:**
>
> ```text
> Scaffold the basic application structure:
> - Create the main App component and set up routing with placeholder components for:
>   - Login
>   - Trip List
>   - Trip Dashboard
>   - Trip Edit
> - Ensure that the navigation (top nav bar or sidebar) is present and can switch between pages.
> - Commit the scaffold code to the repository.
> ```

## 2. Project Architecture Implementation

### 2.1 Frontend Structure

> **Task 1 - Prompt:**
>
> ```text
> Develop a modular frontend architecture:
> - Refactor the basic App to use a clear folder structure (e.g., components, pages, contexts, services).
> - Implement a Context API (or similar state management) to handle global state (user authentication, trip data).
> - Ensure each component is isolated and testable.
> ```

### 2.2 Backend Integration (Firebase)

> **Task 2 - Prompt:**
>
> ```text
> Integrate Firebase services:
> - Configure Firebase for authentication and Firestore.
> - Create a service layer (e.g., firebase.js) to handle Firebase initialization and exports.
> - Set up basic functions for user registration, login, and logout using Firebase Auth.
> - Write simple tests or logs to confirm integration.
> ```

### 2.3 Database Design for Trip Data

> **Task 3 - Prompt:**
>
> ```text
> Design a flexible Firestore schema:
> - Define collections and documents for trips, itineraries, flights, and budgets.
> - Document the intended structure in a README or schema file for future reference.
> - Create and test basic CRUD operations for a "trip" document in Firestore.
> ```

## 3. Security

### 3.1 Authentication System

> ```text
> Build a secure authentication system:
> - Develop registration, login, and password reset screens.
> - Ensure Firebase Auth is used with email/password.
> - Implement form validation and error handling.
> - Integrate security best practices (e.g., HTTPS enforcement, proper error messaging).
> ```

### 3.2 Authorization and Protected Routes

> **Task 2 - Prompt:**
>
> ```text
> Implement authorization in the frontend:
> - Create protected routes that require authentication.
> - Ensure that unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page.
> - Validate user session and token expiration.
> - Include a mechanism to display secure messages or warnings.
> ```

### 3.3 Security Hardening

> **Task 3 - Prompt:**
>
> ```text
> Harden security for the application:
> - Apply Firestore security rules to restrict access based on user authentication.
> - Enforce HTTPS and consider rate limiting for API calls.
> - Document any security configurations and decisions.
> ```

## 4. Core Feature Development

### 4.1 Trip Management (CRUD)

> **Task 1 - Prompt:**
>
> ```text
> Implement trip management functionality:
> - Create UI components for adding, editing, and deleting trips.
> - Ensure trips include details: name, destination, start/end dates, companions, notes.
> - Integrate with Firestore to persist trip data.
> - Validate that the UI updates upon successful CRUD operations.
> ```

### 4.2 Itinerary Planner

> **Task 2 - Prompt:**
>
> ```text
> Build an itinerary planner:
> - Create UI components to add, edit, and delete activities.
> - Ensure each activity has fields: activity name, location, start/end time, and notes.
> - Constrain activities to the trip date range.
> - Integrate the itinerary with the trip dashboard.
> ```

### 4.3 Flight Integration

> **Task 3 - Prompt:**
>
> ```text
> Integrate flight search functionality:
> - Create a UI component to search for flights using the Skyscanner API.
> - Display search results and allow users to save selected flights.
> - Support multi-leg flights and editable flight details.
> - Persist flight data in Firestore and integrate with the trip dashboard.
> ```

### 4.4 Budget Tracker

> **Task 4 - Prompt:**
>
> ```text
> Implement a budget tracking feature:
> - Develop UI components to set a total trip budget.
> - Automatically include flight costs and itinerary-linked expenses.
> - Display a summary showing total spent vs. remaining budget.
> - Ensure data is stored and updated in Firestore.
